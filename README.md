Clone this repository and setup your Apache to use it as
document root. Then configure the `sourceDirectory` to point
to the root directory of your static resources.

Individual files are served as `ldp:NonRDFSource` resources,
and directories are served as `ldp:BasicContainer` resources.
If a static file is a RDF file, then it is served as an `ldp:RDFSource`.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.6+
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

1. clone this repository into a location on a webserver
